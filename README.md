# jbportfolio.v1
Portfolio project for Thinkful.
Very basic design using only HTML and CSS.


Update 4/29/2021

Change log:
- Added <hr> and <article> elements to HTML
- Added Email contact link and cleaned up LinkedIn and Github links by removing the specific link path
- Updated lang to "en-US"
- Checked content via Grammarly
- Checked website against WAVE. It is showing a contrast issue, however the readability of my site is good for now. I will update the color scheme in a later iteration. Wave report: https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://borocodes.github.io/jbportfolio.v1.2/
- Code has been validated. It is suggesting adding a header to the first <section>. However, I want the image before <h2> so I am leaving it as it is. Code validation: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fborocodes.github.io%2Fjbportfolio.v1.2%2F
- Updated README.md
